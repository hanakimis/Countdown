DONE
- Figured out how to get code from paintcode into the actual app. This article was super helpful: https://www.raywenderlich.com/90690/modern-core-graphics-with-swift-part-1
- started Design v2 on another viewController so that I would still have the original design on the first view controller
TODO
- Make the drawing animate (I think I can follow this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26578023/animate-drawing-of-a-circle)
- Make the drawing a percentage / based on size of canvas / autolayout
